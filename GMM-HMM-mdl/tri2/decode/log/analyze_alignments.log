The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 30.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 20.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.6 hours of data, or 3.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 6.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,33.4,98)
