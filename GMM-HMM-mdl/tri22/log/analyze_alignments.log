The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 25.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 87.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 15.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 49.3 hours of data, or 36.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,26.3,84)
