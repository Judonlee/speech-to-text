### Multilingual Speech-To-Text project

From the team: 
As Chinese students studying in the states, we found our speaking habits morphed -- English words and phrases easily get slipped into Chinese sentences. We greatly feel the need to have messaging apps that can handle multilingual speech-to-text translation. So in this task, we are going to develop this function -- build a model using deep learning technologies to corretly translate multilingual audio (having Chinese and English in the same sentence) into text.
