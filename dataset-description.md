1. Discourse particle: We use both English and Mandarin words to represent discourse particle. When the discourse occurs in Mandarin segment, we use words such as [啊], [喔], etc. to represent. When the discourse occurs in English segment, we use words such as [ah], [oh], etc. to represent.
2. Hesitation and filled pause: Filled pause refers to sounds made by people when they are hesitating/thinking. These sounds are indicated by a pair of brackets ( ), such as (er), (erm), etc.
3. Other languages: This group includes languages and dialects other than English and Mandarin. E.g, we find Japanese, Korean and Indian words. E.g, these words were spoken to describe food and places. In addition, the Chinese dialects such as Cantonese and Hokkien, can also be found in the recordings. These foreign language words are indicated by a pair of # within the word, e.g, #nasi-lemak# (a Malay word food dish):
▪	#ah-mah#: It’s Hokkien dialect and it means “old woman”.
